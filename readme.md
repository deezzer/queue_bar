## What Does This Cue Bar Code Do?
This feature allowed for movie producers to emphasize or engage viewers with different types of inline popup modals which users interact with.

When watching a movie online on Facebook, there is a chat area on the bottom. As time passes, so does the queue bar mark. As the queue touches a point in time the application is aware of, a modal displays allowing viewers to interact while watching the movie.

The Jasmine tests cover moments of times before, on, and after a moment that a popup dialog appears.
