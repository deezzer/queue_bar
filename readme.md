## What Does This Cue Bar Code Do?
Say youâ€™re watching a movie online, and there is a chat area on the bottom. As time passes, so does the queue bar mark. As the queue touches a point in time the application knows about, an incline pops up allowing viewers to interact with others watching the movie.

This feature allowed for the movie producers to emphasize or engage viewers with different types of inline popup modals that users can interact with.

To test the time before, on, and after a moment that a popup dialog appears are there in the specs. Javascript can be hard on the eyes, appearing messy with nested functions. But using object literals this way to separate objects and functions makes it more pleasenta to maintain.
