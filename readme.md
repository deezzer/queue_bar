## What Does This Cue Bar Code Do?
This feature allowed for the movie producers to emphasize or engage viewers with different types of inline popup modals that users could interact with.

When watching a movie online on Facebook, and there is a chat area on the bottom. As time passes, so does the queue bar mark. As the queue touches a point in time the application knows about, a modal displays allowing viewers to interact while watching the movie.

The Jasmine tests cover moments of times before, on, and after a moment that a popup dialog appears. Javascript can get messy fast with nested functions. But using object literals this way to separate objects and functions makes it more pleasent to maintain.
