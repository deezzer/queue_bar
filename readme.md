## What Does This Cue Bar Code Do?
This feature allowed for the movie producers to emphasize or engage viewers with different types of inline popup modals that users can interact with.

Say youâ€™re watching a movie online, and there is a chat area on the bottom. As time passes, so does the queue bar mark. As the queue touches a point in time the application knows about, a modal displays allowing viewers to interact watching the movie.

To test the time before, on, and after a moment that a popup dialog appears are there in the specs. Javascript can get messy fast with nested functions. But using object literals this way to separate objects and functions makes it more pleasenta to maintain.
