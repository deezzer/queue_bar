## Queue Bar
This feature allowed for movie producers to emphasize or engage viewers with different types of inline popup modals which users interact with.

When watching a movie online on Facebook, there is a chat area on the bottom. As time passes, so does the queue bar mark location. As the queue touches a point in time the application is aware of, a modal displays allowing viewers to interact while watching the movie.

The Jasmine tests moments of times before, on, and after a moment that a popup dialog appears.
